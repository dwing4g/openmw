# This is a default OpenMW animation blending config, it provides smooth locomotion and snappy attack transitions.
# Meant to be used with OpenMW animation blending system.
#
# HOW TO EDIT ANIMATION CONFIG FILES:
# "From" and "to" are rules that will attempt to match animation names, they usually look like 
# "animationGroupName:keyName" where keyName is essentially a name of a specific action within the animation group. 
# Examples: "weapononehanded: chop start", "idle1h", "jump: start" e.t.c 
# Note that "keyName" is not always present and if omitted - the rule will match any "keyName".
# Different animation names the game uses can be inspected by opening .kf animation files in blender.
#
# Both animationGroupName and keyName support wildcard character either at the beginning, the end of the name, or instead of the name:
# "*" will match any name.
# "*idle:sta*" will match an animationGroupName ending with "idle" and a keyName starting with "sta".
# "weapon*handed: chop*attack" will not work since we don't support wildcards in the middle.
# 
# "easing" is an animation blending function, i.e a style of transition between animations. "sineOut" easing is usually a safe bet.
# For a list of possible easings check OpenMW documention.
#
# "duration" is a transition duration in seconds, 0.2-0.4 are usually reasonable transition times, but this highly depends on your use case.
#
# Bottom-most rule takes precedence.
#
# NOTE TO MOD DEVELOPERS: 
# If you want to provide an animation blending config for your modded animations - DO NOT override this file in your mod,
# instead create a "your_modded_animation_file_name.yaml" file and put it in the same folder with your .kf file. For example
# if your mod includes an "newAnimations.kf" file, you can put a "newAnimations.yaml" file beside it and fill it with your blending rules.
# Animation config files shipped in this fashion will only affect your modded animations and will not meddle with other animations in the game.

blending_rules:  
  # General blending rule, any transition that will not be caught by the rules below - will use this rule
  - from: "*"
    to: "*"
    easing: "sineOut"

  # From anything to sneaking
  - from: "*"

    easing: "springOutWeak"
    duration: 0.4
  # From any to preparing for an attack swing (e.g "weapononehanded: chop start").
  # Note that Rules like *:chop* will technically match any weapon attack animation with
  # an animation key beginning on "chop". This includes attack preparation, attack itself and follow-through.
  # Yet since rules below this block take care of more specific transitions - most likely this block will  
  # only affect "any animation"->"attack swing preparation".
